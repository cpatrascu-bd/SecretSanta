## Description & Purpose

On Christmas, many groups of friends or coleagues organize Secret Santa events.

Usually, organizing a Secret Santa requires all participants to assemble, make name tickets and everyone to pick a ticket.

Sometimes, this goal can be hard to achive, because it is hard to assemble a large group of people.
Also, using the traditional way, some people find out who will give them a gift.

This is where our application intervenes.
Using this project, users will be able to form SecretSanta groups. 
When the group admin decides , the application, for each member group, will radomly select who he will have to give the gift.
This information will be send by email.
